# CurrencyConverter
This repository contains a simple currency converter application built using Java Swing and AWT libraries. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to convert amounts between Indian Rupees (INR) and US Dollars (USD).
The interface is designed to be user-friendly with clear labels, input fields, and buttons for performing conversions and closing the application.
